I took AP Computer Science Principles my junior year of high school, it was the first computer science class I took.
For the final, one part was creating a project. I went way over the requirements by making this, but I had fun, I learned a lot, and I was, and still am, proud of this.

I have included the code, but I think the best way to play it is by going to this link:
