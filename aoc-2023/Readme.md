I decided to use Go this year because I have been using it for my senior project.

It was a great experience, not too much more of a hassle than python last year while being compiled.

I used a few higher-order functions for the first time (days 3 and 8) so one function could work for both parts. 

And in day 8, I tried out some concurrency features to see if I would be able to brute force the solution. I wasn't able to (the answer was in the quadrillions and I don't have a GPU), but it was easy to implement and almost twice as fast.

I'm looking forward to next year when I don't have so much on my plate so I can spend more time on the problems.
