Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/) is a coding challenge the CS professors at Cedarville encourage us to do.

Last year, I mainly learned how to parse files to get the input for the problem. This year I decided I would learn Python and git/GitHub.

I had some experience with Python, but not much and that was when I was new to coding. It's an incredibly popular language, and I figured (correctly) 
that using it would make it easier to focus on solving the problem, not worrying about the language. I went from struggling and slowly writing simple code
to writing a recursive function that was almost perfect first go.

Now, you may notice that there is a Rust file as well. Each day has two problems, and that particular day's part two simply increased the simulation rounds to 10,000.
Even 10 rounds took a few minutes with Python, so I decided I would rewrite it in Rust, continuing the trend of learning new things. I have heard good things 
about it as a performant system programming language that implements memory protection without a garbage collector (which slows performance). Unfortunately, I got busy 
right as I ran into problems compiling and running it, so I never got to see if it worked, but it was good to dip my feet into the waters.

I did all of my coding in Visual Studio Code, which made using git to sync with GitHub very easy after the initial learning curve. Now, I have a better understanding 
how each work, and if I ever have to use git on the bare command line (likely), I will have a good base to build on.

Overall, it was a good experience. I don't know if my problem solving skills improved very much, but I learned industry tools and important languages and had fun with it.
I was even hovering around 10th place in my school (which included prof.s and alumni) before finals week hit and I got too busy.
